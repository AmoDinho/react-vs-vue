# react-vs-vue [ ðŸš§ WIP]
I really enjoy using both React and Vue depending on the project. At the moment there is no clear winner, only certain preferences I enjoy depending on the use case

### Complex Apps

For me at the moment I enjoy using React for projects that have certain complexities. Especially when it comes to created authorized routes.

### Static Site Generators

At the moment I'm inlove with [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/) I've even written my new [Personal website] (https://princeashburton.netlify.com/) in it! 

### Styling

When it comes to styling an app Vue wins out right with the ability to write your CSS in the same file with having to install an additional lib like `Styled Components`. It also really plays well with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
 
# Here are various use cases of the two great frameworks in action. ðŸŽ¥
